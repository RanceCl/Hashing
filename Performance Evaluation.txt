1. The code functioned properly linearly, though became increasingly longer with larger load factors. With a load factor of 0.99, output paused for a few seconds. The output for a double hashed table gave results much faster than the linear, even at a load factor of 0.99. The results for a separate chained table seemed to be slightly faster than that of the double hashed table.

3. The percentage of locations marked as deleted was already high for 50,000 trials, being 89.1583 %. This was increased to 98.3843 % with 100,000 trials, as well as taking a lot longer. 


4. 
The separate chaining seems to use a little more memory overall than open addressing. However, there were never any empty locations marked as deleted.
